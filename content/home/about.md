# About me

I am a full time Professor of the Industrial Engineering Department at UTB (Technological University of Bolivar) in Cartagena de Indias - Colombia. In this moment Iâ€™m developing a doctorate in Network and Information Technologies, my thesis topic is related to develop a recommender system in Virtual Learning Environments (VLE). My research focuses on applying machine learning techniques in social phenomenas. My research is driven by the need for good models to evaluate the impact of new public policy in education, criminology and economics. I am passionate about using data to provide solutions and answers, fostering the objectives decisions based on data. I teach graduate-level courses at UTB on Data Science, Quality Control and Operations Research.
